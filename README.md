# OrderedArrayList
- This class does not have a private Array/ArrayList instance variable because it itself is an ArrayList and therefore already has its own instance variables required for ArrayList operations.
- No nulls is a inherited class because these methods can be applied to other classes that have similar functionality.
- Type T dynamically types objects that are inputted, allowing the program to function correctly with the right calls.
- Can create private method to throw the error if isNull, as that is repetitive code.
